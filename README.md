# What is this?

This is a crude attempt at recreating Jubeat in unity.
It's being designed with the intention of running it on a 12.9" iPad Pro, since it's big and touch screen.

> It is a major WIP, and should not be treated as a supported project.

## Contribution

I initially built this as as weekend project to learn unity, so things are rough and currently pretty crude.
